                <h2>Wake Dust</h2>
                <h4>“The Cowboy”</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="character">
                <h2>Violet Beck</h2>
                <p>
                    A young felon seeking The Cowboy after getting caught in the legal whirlwind of the STAR murder case. 
                    Cool, lazy, and cunning to a fault, she speaks with dry wit and a calm tenacity. Armed with her trusty 
                    modified boxcutter, she never fails to make a proud display of her strong (albeit rusty) hand-to-hand 
                    combat skills gained from time spent serving in Beacon’s military. At birth, she was diagnosed with 
                    Sanguineous Terminus, a bone marrow mutation that causes the overproduction of red blood cells, often 
                    leading to death by internal drowning in patients. Fortunately, she was among the very few whose body 
                    was compatible with experimental treatment at the time and she lived. Through guided practice, she 
                    learned to manipulate her blood as a lethal weapon, as well as a means to speed up her body’s 
                    natural recovery process with a set of techniques now known as Blood Style.

                <h2>General Stanwix</h2>
                <p>
                    A man of the law hellbent on seeing The Cowboy face judgement for his crimes, dead or alive.

                <h2>Kavka</h2>
                <p>
                    An orphan on the run from her abusive caretakers.
                </p>

            <div class="character">
                <h2>Gustaf Gunnarsson</h2>
                <p>
                    The landlord of Rustbelt Ranch, an apartment complex in the tiny strip town of Cladeford. A witty 
                    and perceptive, yet terribly cowardly man, he speaks with a slight accent and gruff, scratchy 
                    groans caused by years of cigarettes and gas station dinners. One might think his monthly earnings 
                    as a business owner would go quite the long way in such an impoverished town, and they’d be correct 
                    if the majority of it hadn’t gone towards feeding his pornography addiction. Due to his many specific 
                    (i.e. expensive) fetishes and severe lack of self-control, he quickly found himself in an ocean of debt, 
                    forcing him to accommodate Crimson County’s more... unsavory potential tenants. That’s how he came 
                    to know his one and only friend, Violet.

                <h2>Emile Caballero</h2>
                <p>
                    The owner of Emile’s Saloon & Grill.

                <h2>Flint & Falke Fredericks</h2>
                <p>
                    The twin nephew-in-laws of Frank Fredericks.
                </p>

                <h2>Frank Fredericks</h2>
                <h4>"The Fellow"</h4>
                <p>
                    The murder victim in the STAR case.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="character">
                <h2>Lieutenant Batista</h2>
                <p>
                    The lieutenant on duty during the events of STAR. A highly ambitious, career-driven woman, she 
                    speaks with a cocky, haughty conviction… so long as she isn’t in the face of authority. This is 
                    due to her understanding of Beacon’s military hierarchy, an atmosphere that conditioned her over 
                    years to respectfully submit to a chain of command. Her learned propensity for following orders 
                    (and making morally bankrupt decisions) granted her the Lieutenant position under newly appointed 
                    General, Machias Stanwix. Under his rule, she begrudgingly carried out routine tasks in hopes that 
                    her efforts would eventually be rewarded with recognition and advancement, only to realize that 
                    he had no intention of sharing the limelight.

            <div class="character">
                <h2>Bulbino</h2>
                <p>
                    The owner of Azanwood Auto Works. Possessing loose cargo and even looser morals, they speak in deep, 
                    flat tones with a distinct Southern twang from their time spent growing up in human-dominated slums. 
                    Having experienced severe poverty firsthand, their life quickly oriented itself around the pursuit 
                    of money. Seeing others attain riches through GATT, yet unable to fight to save their life, Bulbino 
                    turned to the comparatively safe lifestyle of a Keeper, transporting and selling contraband. Though 
                    they do have some skill as a mechanic, their body shop is nothing more than a neat, presentable front. 
                    Just a means to launder their profits, leaving customers like Gustaf to be viewed by Bulbino as mere 
                    tools, serving only to stave away suspicion during routine Beacon inspections.

            <div class="character">
                <h2>Admiral Torrodin</h2>
                <h4>“Victorio”</h4>
                <p>
                    One of three Admirals in Beacon’s military hierarchy. A peaceful powerhouse of a man, he speaks with a 
                    calm intellect and an air of effortless authority. As a natural-born leader of men, Victorio seeks the 
                    best for his many subordinates. This is why it pains him to see General Stanwix wasting time on what he 
                    considers to be a wild goose chase, rather than working towards getting himself out of Crimson County 
                    and preparing for imminent wartime. That, and the fact that he’s got a bit of a soft spot for The Cowboy. 
                    Since that’s his favorite nephew’s favorite Hunter, Victorio played a major role in getting Wake 
                    pardoned during the STAR trial. In his free time, he practices meditation and studies the art of chakra 
                    manipulation. Years of breathing exercises have strengthened his already highly destructive Zephyr Style.

                <h2>?#@*&%</h2>
                <h4>“King”</h4>
                <p>
                    An enigmatic figure. The self-proclaimed “King of the Hunters,” he can cause severe bodily harm seemingly 
                    at the flick of a finger. Though he’s shown a clear lack of regard for human life, his sadistic tendencies 
                    have kept him patient over the years. Often seen in pajamas or other casual wear, his scruffy face and 
                    generally unkempt appearance are a result of a self-imposed vagrancy. While he seems to possess intimate 
                    knowledge about Wake’s life, as well as a desire to assist him (or at the very least, keep him alive), 
                    he claims that they’ve never met in person. Due to his lack of an online presence, his personal motives 
                    for this remain unknown.
