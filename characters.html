                <h2>Wake Dust</h2>
                <h4>“The Cowboy”</h4>
                <p>The one responsible for the STAR incident as well as the single most hated man in the Hunter community. 
                    Initially sentenced to death for the murder of Frank Fredericks, Wake accepted a plea deal for life 
                    imprisonment without parole in exchange for the identities of 11 high threat-level Hunters, the majority 
                    of which were swiftly apprehended soon afterwards. This act led to the loss of millions in sponsorships 
                    and the collapse of the GATT industry, effectively ending the Golden Age of Hunting and drawing criticism 
                    from all sides. Unable to cope with the massive backlash and hostile prison environment, Wake was found 
                    lying in a pool of blood, having taken his own life only months into his sentence. He went down in history 
                     a coward and a traitor.
                    <br><br>
                    …or at least, that's what the public was told. In reality, Wake never saw the inside of a jail cell. 
                    Instead, those 11 names landed him a second chance in the form of a new identity and three years of 
                    witness protection. They sent him to where all things go when Beacon wants them forgotten, Crimson County, 
                    otherwise known as The Lion’s Junkyard. There, he became a construction worker and a day drinker, losing 
                    track of the days as the galaxy slowly moved on from the memory of The Cowboy. But now that three years 
                    have passed and the STAR case has been reopened, it seems as if Wake’s time in the shade has just about 
                    run out. And some people haven’t forgotten.

                <h2>Violet Beck</h2>
                <p>
                    A young felon seeking The Cowboy after getting caught in the legal whirlwind of the reopened STAR case. 
                    Coolheaded and intelligent (though lazy), she speaks with dry wit and a calm tenacity. Armed with her 
                    trusty modified boxcutter, she never fails to make a proud display of her strong (albeit rusty) 
                    hand-to-hand combat skills gained from time spent serving in Beacon military. At birth, she was diagnosed 
                    with Sanguineous Terminus, a bone marrow mutation that causes the overproduction of red blood cells, often 
                    leading to death by internal drowning in patients. Fortunately, she was among the very few whose body was 
                    compatible with experimental treatment at the time and she lived. Through guided practice, she learned to 
                    manipulate her blood as a lethal weapon, as well as a means to speed up her body’s natural recovery process 
                    with a set of techniques now known as Blood Style.

                <h2>General Stanwix</h2>
                <p>
                    A man of the law hellbent on seeing The Cowboy face judgement for his crimes, dead or alive. A former Hunter 
                    himself, he began his military career after turning himself in for arrest following a failed assassination 
                    attempt on the young prince of the sovereign planet, Barikai. Knowing that the boy’s status and age would 
                    constitute a heavier sentence, he offered his services to Beacon. After having his Hunting history revealed 
                    by Wake during the STAR trial, Stanwix lost the title of General he had worked so hard to achieve to John 
                    Adams Bayer and was sent to Crimson County to serve the impoverished in an attempt to rehabilitate his image. 
                    That was the intent, at least. Instead, Stanwix threw himself into work, obsessively compiling evidence 
                    towards a case against Wake in an attempt to close this case once and for all.

                <h2>Kavka</h2>
                <p>
                    The orphan that steals Wake's wallet. A cunning and precocious young girl, her shrill voice and excitable nature 
                    is seldom seen in her effort to appear tougher, leaking out only when fangirling over old-timey Golden Age Hunters. 
                    As the child of a human father and Kali mother, she was born with several mutations (tridactylous limbs and 
                    discolored splotches all over her body, as well as a disfigured left horn) that made her an unpopular adoption 
                    candidate at the orphanage. Feeling pity for her (and seeing an opportunity to save money on hiring a janitor), 
                    Emile decided to take her in, letting her stay in the saloon cellar. Holding out hope that her father is alive 
                    somewhere, she can be found in the Bainbrook City marketplace, pickpocketing the poor in the hopes that she may 
                    one day save up enough to purchase a one-way trip out of Crimson County.

                <h2>Gustaf Gunnarsson</h2>
                <p>
                    The landlord of Rustbelt Ranch, an apartment complex in the tiny strip town of Cladeford. A witty 
                    and perceptive, yet terribly cowardly man, he speaks with a slight accent and gruff, scratchy 
                    groans caused by years of cigarettes and gas station dinners. One might think his monthly earnings 
                    as a business owner would go quite the long way in such an impoverished town, and they’d be correct 
                    if the majority of it hadn’t gone towards feeding his pornography addiction. Due to his many specific 
                    (i.e. expensive) fetishes and severe lack of self-control, he quickly found himself in an ocean of debt, 
                    forcing him to accommodate Crimson County’s more... unsavory potential tenants. That’s how he came 
                    to know his one and only friend, Violet.

                <h2>Emile Caballero</h2>
                <p>
                    The owner of Emile’s Saloon & Grill and Violet's ex-boyfriend. Cousin of notorious drug lord going by the name 
                    of "El Reyayo", Emile is responsible for distribution in Crimson County, keeping competition at bay with his gang, 
                    La Bestia. An avid gambler, compulsive liar, and habitual cheater, Emile views his saloon as a place to launder 
                    money and host drug deals and while this is a well known fact (even to local authorities), he remains untouchable. 
                    This is because he issues loans, having his men serve as his sharks. Operating as a sort of bank in such an 
                    impoverished environment has positioned him as an invaluable resource to the residents of the County, allowing 
                    him to fly under the radar.

                <h2>Flint & Falke Fredericks</h2>
                <p>
                    The twin nephew-in-laws of Frank Fredericks. Given the fact that their uncle (their only known living relative) 
                    is an intergalactic Pirate on the run, they were placed under the legal guardianship of Frank upon his arrest 
                    three years before his murder. As per the instructions in his will, they were enrolled in military school. 
                    Since he didn’t specify as to where, however, Beacon officials took the liberty of dumping them in Crimson County, 
                    as their very existence qualified as bad publicity. There, the twins began attending Bainbrook Preparatory School 
                    where they both strived for high marks, but for opposite reasons. While Falke wants nothing to do with Beacon 
                    (instead studying to get into law school), Flint aims to be placed in a top-tier infantry Division, as while 
                    they seldom participate during wartime, soldiers in them still earn enough to support a cushy lifestyle.

                <h2>Frank Fredericks</h2>
                <h4>"The Fellow"</h4>
                <p>
                    The victim in the STAR case. As the infamous kingpin running the largest network distributing primarily spacedust, 
                    Frank was arrested for various racketeering and drug charges five years before STAR took place. On the night of the 
                    crime, he was being held on the luxurious 50th floor of Booker Ace Penitentiary (receiving special treatment due to 
                    his wealth and connections) when The Cowboy broke into his "cell", setting Frank aflame after a brief conflict. 
                    Thanks to experimental treatment, he had become one of the first users whose body was able to develop and maintain 
                    a second Style alongside his first, but since neither were equipped to withstand prolonged exposure to high 
                    temperature, Frank was killed. Though he doesn't appear to possess any known relatives, he is survived by his 
                    fiancé, J'Wakka, and twin nephew-in-laws, Flint and Falke.

                <h2>Lieutenant Batista</h2>
                <p>
                    The lieutenant on duty during the events of STAR. A highly ambitious, career-driven woman, she 
                    speaks with a cocky, haughty conviction… so long as she isn’t in the face of authority. This is 
                    due to her understanding of Beacon’s military hierarchy, an atmosphere that conditioned her over 
                    years to respectfully submit to a chain of command. Her learned propensity for following orders 
                    (and making morally bankrupt decisions) granted her the Lieutenant position under newly appointed 
                    General, Machias Stanwix. Under his rule, she begrudgingly carried out routine tasks in hopes that 
                    her efforts would eventually be rewarded with recognition and advancement, only to realize that 
                    he had no intention of sharing the limelight.

                <h2>Bulbino</h2>
                <p>
                    The owner of Azanwood Auto Works. Possessing loose cargo and even looser morals, they speak in deep, 
                    flat tones with a distinct Southern twang from their time spent growing up in human-dominated slums. 
                    Having experienced severe poverty firsthand, their life quickly oriented itself around the pursuit 
                    of money. Seeing others attain riches through GATT, yet unable to fight to save their life, Bulbino 
                    turned to the comparatively safe lifestyle of a Keeper, transporting and selling contraband. Though 
                    they do have some skill as a mechanic, their body shop is nothing more than a neat, presentable front. 
                    Just a means to launder their profits, leaving customers like Gustaf to be viewed by Bulbino as mere 
                    tools, serving only to stave away suspicion during routine Beacon inspections.

                <h2>Admiral Torrodin</h2>
                <h4>“Victorio”</h4>
                <p>
                    One of three Admirals in Beacon’s military hierarchy. A peaceful powerhouse of a man, he speaks with a 
                    calm intellect and an air of effortless authority. As a natural-born leader of men, Victorio seeks the 
                    best for his many subordinates. This is why it pains him to see General Stanwix wasting time on what he 
                    considers to be a wild goose chase, rather than working towards getting himself out of Crimson County 
                    and preparing for imminent wartime. That, and the fact that he’s got a bit of a soft spot for The Cowboy. 
                    Since that’s his favorite nephew’s favorite Hunter, Victorio played a major role in getting Wake 
                    pardoned during the STAR trial. In his free time, he practices meditation and studies the art of chakra 
                    manipulation. Years of breathing exercises have strengthened his already highly destructive Zephyr Style.

                <h2>?#@*&%</h2>
                <h4>“King”</h4>
                <p>
                    An enigmatic figure. The self-proclaimed “King of the Hunters,” he can cause severe bodily harm seemingly 
                    at the flick of a finger. Though he’s shown a clear lack of regard for human life, his sadistic tendencies 
                    have kept him patient over the years. Often seen in pajamas or other casual wear, his scruffy face and 
                    generally unkempt appearance are a result of a self-imposed vagrancy. While he seems to possess intimate 
                    knowledge about Wake’s life, as well as a desire to assist him (or at the very least, keep him alive), 
                    he claims that they’ve never met in person. Due to his lack of an online presence, his personal motives 
                    for this remain unknown.
