            <p>GATT is an original 3D animated science fiction series written by Alfonso Vaca and created by Rigved Deshpande.</p>
            <p>GATT is being performed virtually during the pandemic and animated using the Unity game engine. Real time 3D animation is a blazing-fast, exciting new way to create content, and enables a tiny team like ours to tell a huge story. Our voice actors come from all skill levels and together we have been able to pull together an engaging performance while working remotely. GATT is in active development, and there is room for everyone to contribute their talents, try out something new and be a part of this story!</p>
